Build
-----

In development mode:

    mvn clean install -Pdevelopment

... and see a ready to run distribution under `rubia-forums/target/rubia-forums.war`

You can also choose the package mode using the profiles:

    -Pdevelopment
    -Pproduction
    
If you want install in production mode you must use:

    mvn clean install -Pproduction
    
Or simply:

    mvn clean install
    
If you want automatically install and deploy the jsf application in a local active WildFly server:

    mvn install -Pproduction,deploy-jsf
    
If you want automatically uninstall and undeploy the application in a local active WildFly server:

    mvn clean -Pproduction,deploy-jsf
    
If you want automatically reinstall and redeploy the application in a local active WildFly server:

    mvn clean install -Pproduction,deploy-jsf
    
As the same manner you can deploy the rest application instead of the jsf application using the goal deploy-rest. Here a sample:

    mvn clean install -Pproduction,deploy-rest
    
If you want to start a WildFly instance and execute the deploy of the JSF application:

    mvn install -Pproduction,runtime-jsf,deploy-jsf
    
To stop the WildFly instance:
  
    mvn clean -Pruntime-jsf
    
Or for the REST application:

    mvn install -Pproduction,runtime-${distribution}-rest,deploy-rest
    
To stop the WildFly instance:
  
    mvn clean -Pruntime-rest
    
To enable the debug in the started WildFly instance:

    export JAVA_OPTS="-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8000"

to deploy it with the shell command in WildFly:

    $JBOSS_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh
    connect localhost
    deploy /xxxx/rubia-forums.war
   
 to create new users in WildFly:

$JBOSS_HOME/bin/add_user.sh

    What type of user do you wish to add? 
     a) Management User (mgmt-users.properties) 
     b) Application User (application-users.properties)
    (a): b

Enter the details of the new user to add.
Realm (ApplicationRealm) : 
Username : user2
Password : password2
Re-enter Password : password2
What roles do you want this user to belong to? (Please enter a comma separated list, or leave blank for none) : users
The username 'admin' is easy to guess
Are you sure you want to add user 'admin' yes/no? yes


to test the web application with selenium:

    deploy the application in a server
    mvn -Pselenium test
    
to test the rest api with junit:

    deploy the rest api in a server
    mvn -Prest-test test

To debug the application using Eclipse you can put this parameter:

    mvn -Dmaven.surefire.debug test

It will start on the 5005 port.

The tests are done using Firefox 63.0.3 (64-bit) on WildFly 16.0.0-SNAPSHOT
