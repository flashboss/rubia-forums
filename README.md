Build

In development mode:

    mvn clean install -P${distribution},development

... and see a ready to run distribution under `rubia-forums/target/rubia-forums.war`

list of distribution profiles:

    -Pwildfly-remote-900               wildfly as 9.0.0
    -Pwildfly-remote-901               wildfly as 9.0.1
    -Pwildfly-remote-902               wildfly as 9.0.2
    -Pwildfly-remote-1000              wildfly as 10.0.0

You can also choose the package mode using the profiles:

    -Pdevelopment
    -Pproduction
    
If you want install in production mode you must use:

    mvn clean install -P${distribution},production
    
If you want automatically install and deploy the jsf application in a local active wildfly server:

    mvn install -P${distribution},production,deploy-jsf
    
If you want automatically uninstall and undeploy the application in a local active wildfly server:

    mvn clean -P${distribution},production,deploy-jsf
    
If you want automatically reinstall and redeploy the application in a local active wildfly server:

    mvn clean install -P${distribution},production,deploy-jsf
    
As the same manner you can deploy the rest application instead of the jsf application using the goal deploy-rest. Here a sample:

    mvn clean install -P${distribution},production,deploy-rest

to deploy it with the shell command in Wildfly:

    $JBOSS_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh
    connect localhost
    deploy /xxxx/rubia-forums.war
   
 to create new users in Wildfly:

$JBOSS_HOME/bin/add_user.sh

    What type of user do you wish to add? 
     a) Management User (mgmt-users.properties) 
     b) Application User (application-users.properties)
    (a): b

Enter the details of the new user to add.
Realm (ApplicationRealm) : 
Username : user2
Password : password2
Re-enter Password : password
What roles do you want this user to belong to? (Please enter a comma separated list, or leave blank for none) : users
The username 'admin' is easy to guess
Are you sure you want to add user 'admin' yes/no? yes


to test it with selenium:

    deploy the application in a server
    mvn -P${distribution},selenium test

If your web application uses a default locale different by the english you must set in the 'selenium' profile in the pom.xml:

	mvn -P${distribution},selenium test -Duser.language=it -Duser.region=IT
		
In this sample you must set the testing in the italian language.

To debug the application using Eclipse you can put this parameter:

    mvn -Dmaven.surefire.debug test

It will start on the 5005 port.

The tests are done using:

- Firefox 43.0.3 on wildfly 9.0.0
- Firefox 43.0.3 on wildfly 9.0.1
- Firefox 43.0.3 on wildfly 9.0.2
- Firefox 44.0.2 on wildfly 10.0.0
